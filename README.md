**India CPI Inflation Case Study**

**Overview**: In India, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure inflation, and it
involves a fixed basket of goods and services. This basket is comprehensive and
includes a wide array of items that an average Indian consumer uses. These items are
not limited to just food and clothing but extend to transportation, medical care,
electricity, education, and almost every other category that involves expenditure of
money. The CPI is calculated by comparing the general price level in the markets during
a particular time period with a base year. The items in the CPI basket are classified
across various categories like food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, and
recreation, among others.

**Problem Statement:**
You are working with the National Statistical Office which is equipped to release
inflation numbers in India. As an analyst, you are provided with CPI data and are
equipped find out insights from the data. Your senior wants you to find key trends and
deep dive into the data to answer the following questions 

**1**. Based on the latest month’s data, identify the contribution of different broader
categories (food, energy, transportation, education, etc.) towards the CPI basket.
Broader categories can be created by combining similar categories into 1; Ex.: Meals,
Beverages, Cereals, can be clubbed to create “Food” category, etc.
Which category has the highest contribution towards CPI calculation.

**2.** A trend of Y-o-Y increase in CPI (rural + urban) inflation starting 2017 for
the entire basket of products combined. The General Index gives you the
overall Inflation for the month.
Create a graph depicting the growth rate Y-o-Y and identify the year with highest
inflation rate
Highlight the reason why the year has the highest inflation (based on research).

**3.** With India's retail inflation reaching a 3-month high of 5.55% in November 2023,
largely due to a sharp rise in food prices. Analyze which specific food items have
contributed the most to this increase during 12 months ending May’2023
Investigate trends in the prices of broader food bucket category and evaluate
month-on-month changes
Identify the absolute changes in inflation over the same 12 months period and
identify the biggest contributor of individual category (within broader food
category) towards inflation.

**4.** Investigate how the onset and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic affected
inflation rates in India. Analyze the impact of key pandemic milestone (e.g.,
lockdowns) on the CPI Inflation % particularly focusing on categories like healthcare,
food, and essential services.
Hint: You can consider Mar’20 as the onset of covid, and can compare inflation trend
before and after this. .

**5**. Investigate how major global economic events (like imported oil price fluctuations)
have influenced India's inflation. This can include an analysis of imported goods and
their price trends.
For the purpose of this analysis, focus only on the imported oil price fluctuations
for years 2021 to 2023 (Month-on-month)
Identify trends in oil price change with change in inflation prices of all the
categories and identify the category whose inflation prices strongly changes with
fluctuations in imported oil price (Hint: you can use =correl function)
